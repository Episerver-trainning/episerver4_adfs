    <h1>Manage Web Addresses</h1>
 
	<p>The adress to the Web site can be shown in the address 
	field in three different ways with EPiServer. It can be completely dynamic 
	and reproduce the unique page’s ID number. The dynamic address can also be 
	adapted so that the search engines can index the Web site. It is also 
	possible to show the address based upon the structure of the Web site. This 
	can be controlled by the editor adding a name for each page or it being 
	controlled by the name of the page.</p>


	<p>Most Internet search engines search Web sites for information and then 
	store the information in their databases. This is known as indexing Web 
	sites. Most search engines cannot index Web sites when the address includes 
	a question mark (?). By default, all EPiServer page addresses contain a 
	question mark and a unique number. You must adjust the page addresses to 
	allow search engines to index the Web site automatically. </p>
	<p>If you want Internet search engines to be able to index your Web site, 
	mark the option <i>Use Web addresses that allow search engines to crawl the Web site</i>, 
	and then select <i>Save</i>. <br>
	If you now look at the address for a specific page, EPiServer has changed it 
	from www.foretaget.se/templates/page.aspx?id=1234 to 
	www.foretaget.se/templates/page____1234.aspx. This shows that the page can 
	be indexed.</p>
	<p>If you want the address to be shown based upon the 
	structure, you activate this by selecting the <i>Use web addresses that 
	reflect the structure structure of the content for this Web site’s </i>&nbsp;option and select <i>Save</i>. 
	If you have upgraded a previous version of EPiServer to 4.60, this option is 
	not active. To activate this you must change a setting in web.config. </p>
