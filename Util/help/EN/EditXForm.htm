    <h1>Form Settings</h1>
The dialog box <i>Edit form</i> is used for 
		creating/editing a form. Here, you can build up a table and add the 
		different form fields as you want. You can also select the properties 
		each field is to have. </p>
	
			<ol>
				<li>In the <i>Name of form</i> field, you select a 
			name for the form. If you are going to send the form by e–mail, the 
			name will be shown in the Subject row on the e-mail message being 
			sent. This name is also displayed in the list of available forms, so 
			you can use this form on another page. </li>
				<li>In the <i>Directory for the form</i> field, you 
			choose which directory the form should be placed in. </li>
				<li>The <i>Form can be sent without logging on</i> 
			field should be selected if you want anyone on your Web site to be 
			able to send in the form. If it is not checked, the visitor must be 
			logged on in order to reply. </li>
				<li>The <i>Same person can send the form several 
			times</i> field should be selected if you want the same person 
			(computer user) to be able to send the form several times. If this 
			option is left empty, visitors will only be able to send in the form 
			once per computer. This works by placing a cookie on the visitor's 
			computer. </li>
				<li>In the <i>Thank you page shown upon response</i> 
			field, you can point to a page that is to be shown when a visitor 
			submits a response. Create the page on the <i>Ordinary Web page</i> 
			page template and then select the page as a thank you page.</li>
	</ol>

	<h2>Building up the form</h2>
In the lower part of <i>Edit form</i> you create a table 
	with the buttons below the table. <i>Add row</i> is always placed at the 
	bottom of the table. <i>Add column</i> is always placed furthest right in 
	the table. If you select <i>Insert row</i> you can insert a row above the 
	row that is currently selected. <i>Insert column</i> opens a column to the 
	left of the selected column. Select a row or column by clicking on an 
	inserted field in the cell. If there are no fields in the table, you can 
	start by dragging in a field. </p>
	<p >Position the various fields by grabbing the field in 
	question at the right edge and dragging it to the required position in the 
	table. Each cell in the table can only contain one form field. When you have dragged a form field into the cell, the 
	settings for the relevant field type will be opened to the right of the 
	table. Depending on the field you have selected, you need to make various 
	settings. Some properties exist in all types of field, and some in all input 
	fields. These properties exist in all fields:</p>
	
					<h3>CSS class</h3>
	
	is a field where you can define a CSS class (format) for 
	what the field should look like. The class must be present in the CSS file 
	used for the Web site. Contact your system administrator for more 
	information. </p>


					<h3>Name</h3>

	is the field where you define a name for the field, which 
	enables you to know which field the visitor has filled in. The simplest 
	thing is to use the same or similar name to the one you used in the heading 
	field which belongs to the field. You can only use A-Z, a-z, 1-9 and _. 
	Spaces cannot be used. </p>
	
					<h3>Heading</h3>
				
	can be created in a field of its own, or you can write it 
	in conjunction with the input field. If you write it in conjunction with the 
	input field, the heading will be displayed to the left of the field. This 
	alternative should be selected in order to make the form highly accessible. 
	A heading is the text to be displayed to visitors so that they know what to 
	fill in. </p>
	<h3>Screen tips</h3>
			is a field where you can give visitors more information 
	about what to fill in. The text in the screen tip is displayed when you move 
	the mouse over the input field. </p>
	<h3>Value must be entered</h3>
			is a field that means that you are forcing the visitor to 
	enter a value in the field. If the visitor leaves the field empty, an error 
	message is displayed saying that the field must be filled in. The error 
	message refers first to the text you have specified in the heading field. If 
	you do not have any heading, it refers to whatever you have entered in the
	<i>Name</i> field. </p>
	<h3>Validate as</h3>
		is a field that enables you to check whether the visitor 
	has filled in the right type of information in a field. You can check 
	whether it is an e-mail address, check various date formats and various 
	types of numbers.</p>
	<p >When all the properties for each field have been 
	completed, the button <i>Save</i> will be shown under the properties. You 
	must save each individual field and its settings. If you want to delete a 
	field, select the <i>Delete</i> button under the field's properties. </p>
		<h3>Heading</h3>
	Heading is the field type used to let visitors know what 
	they should enter in each field. </p>

	<h3>Text field</h3>

	input field in the form of a row in which they can enter text. This is used 
	for short text information you want the visitor to enter. </p>
			<ul>
				<li>In the <i>Width</i> field, enter how wide the field 
		is to be in terms of characters. </li>
				<li>The <i>Value must be entered</i> field should be 
		selected if you do not want visitors to be able to send in the form 
		without filling in this particular field. </li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Button</h3>
	Use of this button to give visitors a button to press 
	when they want to send in the form.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>In the <i>Button text</i> field, enter the text to be 
		displayed on the button. </li>
				<li>In the <i>Result from posting</i> field, select what 
		will happen when the visitor sends in the form. You can select to save 
		it in a database and/or send it by e-mail. You can also specify that the 
		form should be sent to a Web address where you can have a separate 
		application dealing with the information. Depending on the option you 
		choose, different fields are shown.</li>
				<li>In the <i>Send e-mail to this address </i>field, 
		state the e-mail address that a message should be sent to when a visitor 
		posts a form.</li>
				<li>In the <i>E-mail sender</i> field, state the sender’s 
		address that should be in the message sent. </li>
				<li>In the <i>E-mail subject</i> field, state the heading 
		that should be shown in the subject box in the message that is sent when 
		a visitor sends a form.</li>
	</ul>

<h3>Text area</h3>
	Text area is the field type which gives visitors a large 
	area in which to type in text. You can decide the width of the area in terms 
	of characters and how many rows the field should have. </p>
			<ul>
				<li>In the <i>Width</i> field, enter how wide the field 
		is to be in terms of characters. </li>
				<li>In the <i>Height</i> row, specify the number of rows 
		that the text area should have.</li>
	</ul>


<h3>Select box</h3>
The Select box is the field type which gives visitors a 
	pull-down menu in which they can select one of several alternatives which 
	you have specified. </p>

		<ul>
			<li>In the <i>Options</i> field, enter the various 
		options which the visitors are to choose from. Type in the options and 
		separate them by pressing ENTER between each option. </li>
	</ul>

	properties have been saved, save the entire form with the Save button in the

	your form, you can find all the forms which have been submitted under the <i>
