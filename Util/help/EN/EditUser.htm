    <h1>Edit User</h1>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All persons who in any way are, or have been, logged onto 
    the website are stored in EPiServer. Some of them are created in EPiServer, 
    others in Windows. When you create a user, or the users create themselves 
    through self-registration, their details are entered. To edit these details 
    later, search for the user under Search user/group and then edit the user. 
    All persons with access to Edit mode can modify some of their details under 
    My Settings. You can modify more information from Admin mode, such as 
    username and password, when the account should be active, the group in which 
    the user is a member etc. </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These properties can only be modified for the users that 
    have been created through self-registration or via Create user. These users 
    are marked with a globe symbol in the search result. Modifying this type of 
    information for a Windows user has to be done in Windows. From Admin mode 
    you can modify the same details for a Windows user as the user can 
    themselves via Edit mode.</p>
    <h1>Create User</h1>
    <p>Using the option <i>Create user</i> you can set up users in EPiServer, 
    who do not exist in Windows. This option is used in most cases when setting 
    up an extranet and you want to grant permissions to people who are not 
    usually accessible in the Windows system. Enter the information about the 
    user and select which group or groups he/she is going to belong to and click 
    on <i>Add user</i>.</p>

	Display options</h2>
	
	<p>The <i>Display alternatives</i> tab is for each editor to 
	be able to decide what they want to show in the stucture in edit mode. There 
	are two different settings. The first is that you can have an extended or 
	limited toolbar. In the limited toolbar, the buttons are shown on one row, 
	which can be practical when you have a small screen. The extended toolbar is 
	shown on two rows and contains a few extra functions. </p>
	<p>It is also possible to choose which symbols will be shown 
	in the tree structure. Sometimes there are a lot of symbols on some pages 
	and it is possible to close them, for those editors that don’t need the 
	symbols. </p>
	<p>Editors can change the settings themselves under <i>My 
	settings</i>. These settings can also be made when the account is created. 
	All editors are given the extended toolbar and all symbols in the tree 
	structure as default setting. A default setting is a setting that can be 
	reset in web.config.</p>
