					<h1>Mirroring Administration</h1>
			
					<p>Mirroring is a function that can be used 
					to mirror content from one Web site to another. EPiServer 
					can be used to mirror selected parts or all of a Web site. 
					Mirroring can run automatically, or you can start it 
					manually. You can also mirror from one EPiServer to another 
					EPiServer. This can be very useful if you wish to create 
					large sections in a test environment and then publish all 
					the information at once on the public section. Another 
					useful function: create a HTML-based Web site using your 
					dynamic EPiServer, which can be extremely good for 
					archiving. </p>
					
					<p>A mirror from one Web site to another is 
					built up through channels on the Web site that transmits 
					information. It is also possible to define several channels. 
					Each channel consists of a number of settings for the pages 
					that are to be mirrored and, of these, the types of page to 
					be included. One of a channel’s most important properties is 
					the kind of a channel it is:</p>
			
					<ul>
						<li>
							<b>Tree</b>
						- This function finds all changes made in the tree. It finds pages that have 
						been moved, erased, updated or created. The function finds all the changes from 
						the root page down in the structure. This function is primarily used to mirror 
						an exact tree structure. In this case, a page deleted on one Web site must also 
						be deleted on the other.
						<li>
							<b>List</b>
						- This function works like Tree, except it does not include changes below the 
						first level.
						<li>
							<b>Search</b> - This function finds changed and new pages. It is useful when 
							you wish to mirror news from one Web site to another.
						</li>
					</ul>
