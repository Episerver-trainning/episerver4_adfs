					<h1>WSRP Sources</h1>
			
					<p>WSRP (Web Service for Remote Portlets) is 
					a technology and standard that means that it is possible to 
					consume and produce information and services that can be 
					used by others without actually needing technical platforms.
					</p>
					<p>At the core of the technology, you build 
					so-called <i>Portlets</i>, which produce various types of 
					information or services. Applications/services (so-called 
					producer) can have several portlets that produce contents 
					and services from its own application. It is the producer 
					that primarily decides what can be consumed by someone else.
					</p>
					<p>EPiServer supports the producer and the 
					consumer. This means that you can allow others to use 
					information from your Web site through portlets created in 
					EPiServer. In a standard installation of EPiServer there are 
					examples of producing page contents, news, etc. With the 
					help of the EPiServer Portal Framework, it is also possible 
					to consume information from other WSRP sources. Read more 
					about Portals and WSRP in <i>EPiServer Portals</i>. </p>
					<p>To be able to consume portlets in 
					EPiServer, you must have EPiServer Portal Framework. In a 
					standard installation there is a demo example of it. Contact 
					your supplier if you want to use EPiServer Portal Framework 
					in scrape operation. To be able to consume portlets in 
					EPiServer, you also need to add the various sources that 
					will be available in admin mode.</p>
					<p><b>Add a new WSRP source as follows:</b> </p>
					
						<ol>
							<li>Select <i>WSRP sources</i> on the <i>Config</i> tab. 
							</li>
							<li>Select <i>Register new</i>. If you 
						want to change an existing source, click on the name.
							</li>
							<li>Enter a name for the source in the 
						Name field. This is an arbitrary name that will be shown 
						to users of the portal. </li>
							<li>You can either choose to provide the 
						source through WSDP or via Web services. If you choose
							<i>Register WSDL</i>, provide the source in a field. If 
						you choose <i>Register Web services </i>, you must 
						provide addresses to the source in four fields. You can 
						obtain these details from the WSRP service provider. 
							</li>
							<li>Select <i>Save</i>.</li>
					</ol>
					</dir>
					<p>By choosing the <i>Test</i> button, you 
					can test the source. </p>
